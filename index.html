          <h2>Alcina in Concert</h2>
          <p class="left-align light">The adaptation of this opera is intended as a semi-staged collage of materials from George Frideric Handel’s great opera, ‘Alcina.’ It is a chance to enjoy the spectacular arias of this opera with theatrical staging to connect the characters, story, music and drama.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Handel draws upon the colorful characters of Ariosto’s epic poem, ‘Orlando Furioso,’ in this drama of twisted love, passionate lust, disguised personalities, and magical play. Drama and music are woven together to develop this opera seria steeped in mythological knights and sorceress queens, all of whom are vulnerable to their raw emotions and human faults. This concert adaptation invites the enchanting music and gripping drama to bring life to the tale of Handel’s ‘Alcina.’</p>

          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p class="center-align light"></p>
          <h3>Scene I</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">In the opening Recitativo, Bradamante and Melisso have arrived on Alcina's magical island disguised and in search of Bradamante's betrothed, Ruggiero. Alcina welcomes the visitors to her island (Recit: Alcina, Bradamante, Melisso). Alcina then sings of her adoration for Ruggiero, whom she has taken as lover, (Alcina: Di' cor mio). After Alcina's exit, Ruggiero confirms his love for Alcina (unaware it is a spell), and casts off the visitors for challenging his affections (Ruggiero: Di te mi rido). Ruggiero exits in search of Alcina, leaving Bradamante cruelly spurned and confused.</p>

          <h3>Scene II</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Alcina's capricious sister, Morgana approaches Bradamante and sings of her new feelings in her flirtatious aria, (Morgana: O sapre al riso). Following her display of affection for Bradamante, Morgana's lover Oronte becomes angry and confronts Bradamante (Recit: Oronte). Caught between lovers, Bradamante tells Morgana that her feelings are the cause of problems for both of them, and Oronte to calm his jealousy (Bradamante: E gelosia). As a response to Bradamante, Oronte offers some advice that men should never trust women, as inspired by his own lover, Morgana (Oronte: Semplicetto!). Further angering Oronte, Morgana calls after Bradamante to return, and reiterates her new-found love (Morgana: Tornami).</p>

          <h3>Scene III</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">As the spell has been lifted thanks to Melisso’s magical ring, Ruggiero sings oh how he can now see Alcina's sorcery (Ruggiero: Qual Portendo). Melisso reminds Ruggiero that in loving Alcina, he has cruelly hurt his true love, Bradamante (Melisso: Pensa a chi). Reality is still dazed, but Ruggiero sings that he feels awful if what Melisso says is true (Ruggiero: Mi lusinga).  Alcina hears of Ruggiero's realization, and sings of both her broken heart and feelings of vengeance (Alcina: Ah! Mio cor).</p>

          <h3>Intermission</h3>

          <h3>Scene IV</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Act two will open to find Oronte singing of women's trickery, (Oronte: E un folle). Morgana enters pleading for Oronte to take her back now that Bradamante has been reunited with Ruggiero (Recit: Oronte+Morgana, Aria Morgana: Credete al mio). Oronte then sings that a moment of love is worth more than the pain (Oronte: Un momento di). Despite Morgana’s wandering fidelity, the lovers are reunited.</p>

          <h3>Scene V</h3>
          <p class="left-align light">Alcina is furious with Ruggiero and calls him a traitor for abandoning her (Recit: Ruggiero+Alcina, Aria Alcina: Ma quando). Preparing to battle the monsters and sea storms of Alcina’s sorcery, Ruggiero sings (Ruggiero: Sta nell'Ircana). Melisso urges Bradamante to find safety (Recit: Bradamante+Melisso), but Bradamante is unafraid, as true and faithful love will prevail despite Alcina's sorcery (Bradamante: Alma fedel). Alcina, defeated and scorned, sings of cruel Ruggiero and Bradamante, while Bradamante and Ruggiero are reunited and sing of love conquering evil (Trio: Alcina, Ruggiero, Bradamante: Non e amor).</p>
